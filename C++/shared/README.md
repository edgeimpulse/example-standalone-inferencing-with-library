# Edge Impulse Example: stand-alone inferencing (C)

This builds and runs an exported impulse locally on your machine. It compiles the inferencing library, and then links it to a C application. See the documentation at [Running your impulse locally -> Using the library from C](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/run-inference/cpp-library/running-your-impulse-locally#using-the-library-from-c). 

There is also a [C++ version](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/example-standalone-inferencing) of this application.
